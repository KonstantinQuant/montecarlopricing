# Monte Carlo Option Pricing Codes

### Python Monte Carlo Pricing Application with:
1. Confidence Intervals
2. Antithetical Draws (averaging reduces variance)
3. Numerical Greeks (Derivatives) by shifts
4. Simulated forward prices
5. Simulated Spread Option prices
6. Correlated GBM

### Alienating Swift to write a Monte Carlo Simulation Option Pricing application.

### Matlab Monte Carlo Pricing based on geometric Brownian Motion
